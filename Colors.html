Here are two classics you will recognize on this page:
	• Color - Allows you to create a color.
	• Colors - Ready-made colors.

Here is a simple example of creating a color and using it:
<pre style="font-family: monospace; color: white; font-size: 17px; background: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">from pyprinty import Color, Colors


red = Colors.RED
print(red.string() + "message in red!")

</pre>
What happened here?
I defined a red color, according to the red color ready in the library.
And you need to understand, Colors.RED, contains a color value in RGB format (expanded later),
To use an RGB value in a string, it looks like this:
"\033[38;2;R;G;Bm"
Don't worry, so you don't get confused with this, I created this library.
So when we called red.string() it returned the corresponding string according to the color that was defined to it, in this case (255, 0, 0).
If you understand what RGB and (255, 0, 0) mean, skip the next paragraph.

RGB is a way to represent color, RGB is an acronym for red, green, blue.
These three colors are called "primary colors" because from their different combinations, any color can be produced.
If you've heard that the three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow (RYB), that's also true.
Red, blue, and yellow are the three primary pictorial colors, which are mixed in different amounts to create colors.
Regarding light, the three primary colors are red, green, and blue.
In our case, we use RGB because it's a screen, that is, light.
How do you represent a color in this way?
Each color represented by RGB will receive three values.
One expresses red, one green, and one blue. Each of the three values,
is a number, and it ranges from 0-255.
This number expresses the intensity for each of the three colors and by combining different intensities, we arrive at different colors, which are all the colors we know.
0 is the lowest intensity and 255 is the highest, why isn't there more?
255 is the maximum value for the intensity of the color.
So regarding what I said at the end of the previous paragraph, the red object's RGB value is set to (255, 0, 0), these are the three values ​​of red, green, and blue in the red object, in order of the initials.
So within the red object, red is set to maximum, while blue and green are set to minimum, so this is the strongest red that can be achieved.
If we wanted a weaker red, we would leave the green and blue at 0, and simply lower the value of red according to the strength we want.
When all colors are at 0, black is obtained, and when all colors are at 255, white is obtained.
Any combination of the intensities of colors will give a new color.

If you want to create a color yourself, you will use the Color object, and enter the three RGB values ​​into it.
For example:
<pre style="font-family: monospace; color: white; font-size: 17px; background: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">from pyprinty import Color, Colors


red = Color(255, 0, 0)
print(red.string() + "message in red!")

</pre>
The red object actually contains the same color as in the previous example, only manually.

Notice that I showed you this because you will use these objects to create colors,
but,
I did not intend for you to use the string() method of these objects,
I showed you this to provide you with an overall understanding.
How do I expect you to use this? Through a font.
