Hello, you have arrived at the documentation of the pyprinty library.
My name is Yedidya, I really like computers and especially the Python language.
(You are welcome to contact me about anything by email: yd.sc.20@gmail.com)

I created this library to enable a higher-level interface, and textual.
In this documentation I am going to explain to you how to use the library's features in the best way.

So what is pyprinty about?
pyprinty is designed to make the full capabilities of the print command more easily accessible.
The library uses only Python's built-in libraries.
Because of this, the library is relatively simple to understand, and I more than invite you to take a look at it.
The commands that the library innovates are mainly:
	• Convenience.
	• Use of special characters that are not always familiar.
	• Extraction of the parameters and capabilities of the print command.

Because much of the library is built on special characters, it's important for me to emphasize:
Not every console supports all characters.
Some support nothing, some support everything.
If you're on Windows, I recommend you make sure you have a Windows terminal, it supports most things.
Besides, I made a function called good for you that checks if the console supports it.
It's not accurate.
I work with pycharm and I can say that it doesn't support most of what the library offers, and that definitely made development difficult...
But in any case, it's the best you can get, and if you want to make something like,
A simple text game, a non-graphical interface for a program that only needs communication, Convenience of printing in the console,
pyprinty can definitely upgrade your performance.
