<h2 style="color: #007ACC;">So what can you do with the library?</h2>

The library commands deal with:
	• Formatted text (as much as possible).
	• Special prints.
	• Manage prints.

You can create with it:
	• A loading screen to show progress.
	• Simple text animation.
	• In-game messages to the user in a customized way.
And much more.

And all this, with endless possibilities, because you build it yourself, the library provides tools.

How far can you go?
Not too much, but definitely a few levels above the regular print command.

If you want to see a simple demo I made:
After importing the library in cmd:
<pre style="font-family: monospace; color: white; font-size: 17px; background: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">pip install pyprinty</pre>
Or via <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyprinty/" style="color: #88c0d0; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pypi</a>,
You can open a python file and import from the library:
<pre style="font-family: monospace; color: white; font-size: 17px; background: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">from pyprinty import demo</pre>
Now note, this is intentionally made to start immediately, and I promise this is the only thing that works like this.
If you see: "is not good terminal!"
Then make sure you get a terminal like windows terminal.
If you don't see it, you already see for yourself what the library is capable of.
